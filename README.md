# Progmod repo is where I am storing the answers to the exercises for my programming module (Sem 1 2025)

## How to use this:
- Look inside src to find the code
- Main.py can be ignored.
- If ever needed, this repo can be downloaded and unzipped or git clone

## Current legend / key:

- wk02.py = week 2 exercises
- wk05.py = week 5 exercises
- And this pattern continues

## The projects folder can be used for seeing different projects you can do and how I have implemented them
- Calculator is a good project for the week 8 test
